      "description": "A self-initiated project to build and design a colour palette builder and manager. I used React for the front-end, Laravel to create an API that manages users saved palettes and an external free API to fetch information on specific colours. The application allows a user to randomly generate a colour palette, along with numerous additional functionality to control customisation in order to quickly create and store their ideal palette. The colorator API is fully tested using Laravels testing capabilities.",
