      "description": "A self-initiated project to build and design a colour palette tool. I used React to make a dynamic front-end, Laravel to create an API that manages users saved palettes and an open source API fetches specific colour infomation. The application allows a user to randomly generate a colour palette, along with numerous additional functionality to control customisation, helping to quickly create and store their ideal palette(s)! The colorator API is tested using Laravels testing capabilities.",

I didn't use a framework in order to gain a deeper understanding of CRUD operations. This was an individual project with pull request reviews required upon the completion of each story and is fully unit tested.",
