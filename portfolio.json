      "description": "A self-initiated project to build and design a colour palette builder and manager. I used React for the front-end, Laravel to create an API that manages users saved palettes and an external free API (thecolorapi) to fetch information on specific colours. The application allows a user to randomly generate a colour palette, add and remove colour panels to tailor the number of colours within a palette (2-5), move panels to customise the palette composition, lock-in colour panels so they are exempt from the random generator, specify a colour via hex code input, or colour picker, and retrieve a mono-chromed palette based of a specific shade. The colorator API is fully tested using Laravels testing capabilities",

Created using OOP principles with vanilla PHP and a MySQL database, and without a framework in order to gain a deeper understanding of CRUD operations.
